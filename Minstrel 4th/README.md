This is an enhanced version of Jupiter ACE Forth.

New commands are added, based upon those from here:

* https://github.com/nihirash/Minstrel4th-rom-patch

The original version supports a 6850 serial card, such as:

The current versions instead support the new Software Serial Card:

This is still experimental, a release version is to follow.
